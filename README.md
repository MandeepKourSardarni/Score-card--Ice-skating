This project began from a very personal place. My child skates in short track competitions, and every meet I found myself struggling to manually track points, placements, and progress. Between cheering, timing, and supporting them, it became hard to stay organized — and I didn’t want stress to take away from their joy on the ice.

So I built this dashboard as a simple way to follow along with their improvements.
But to celebrate effort, growth, and confidence. ❤️⛸️

As a caring parent, I just wanted something that makes things easier — a tool that helps me encourage them, stay present, and enjoy every moment of their journey. ❄️✨⛸️
I hope this simple tool helps other parents, too, who just want to keep things organized while cheering with a full heart. ❄️⛸️

## 🎯 Purpose

This is not an official timing or scoring program.
It is a small project built by a parent — for other parents, skaters, and coaches — to make competition days easier, calmer, and more encouraging.

If it helps even one young skater track their improvement & progress, it has already achieved its purpose.
